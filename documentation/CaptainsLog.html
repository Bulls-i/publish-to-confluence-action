<h3>What is a code of conduct?</h3>
<p>A code of conduct is a set of values, rules, standards, and principles outlining what employers expect from staff within an organization.</p>
<p>Often codes of conduct take big picture ideas tied to the business’s overall mission and core values and relate them to the behavior and practices they desire from staff on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Creating a code of conduct is a statement from leadership laying out their expectations and communicating the ethical principles they feel are most fundamental to success. Generally, it reflects the culture already present, or the culture leadership is looking to promote.</p>
<p>A code of conduct is closely related to a code of ethics, to the extent where the phrases are often interchangeable.</p>
<p>However, while there is tremendous overlap, there is also a slight nuance between the two</p>
<p>A code of ethics is broader, providing a set of principles that affect employee mindset and decision-making.
A code of conduct offers principles defining the ethics of a business, but it also contains specific rules for employee actions and behavior.
Generally, both are combined into a single document, and an organization rarely has a different code for each.</p>
<p>A code of conduct in practice can range from big picture ideals to specific rules. For example, a code of conduct can outline how employees should behave to reflect the organization’s wider mission, but it can also define fixed regulations related to internal practices such as dress code or break policy.</p>
<p>A code of conduct could emphasize ethical attitudes and staff communication policies to prevent conflict or harassment while also outlining the consequences for poor behaving that violates the code.</p>
<h3>Why create a code of conduct</h3>
<p>You can think of adopting a code of conduct as the organization making a commitment to self-regulation. Leadership is putting into writing the conduct they expect from their employees and the ethical principles they want to guide them.</p>
<p>With a code of conduct in place, the organization has a framework to inform ethical decision-making for each and every stakeholder. While it isn’t a turn-key solution to every dilemma an employee faces, it shows staff the organization’s guiding principles and helps them make better choices in their daily activities.</p>
<p>A code of conduct is also a vital part of a company’s compliance and legal policies. For example, in the US, public organizations must have a code of conduct in place. Plus, from a compliance point of view, if an employee engages in illegal activity while at work, a code of conduct provides documentation showing they broke company policy.</p>
<h4>By creating a code of conduct:</h4>
<p>The staff understands what rules and expectations management has. It defines how to act while at work, how to communicate both internally and externally, and helps employees be successful at the company.
The organization has concrete company policies to help compliance.
Potential customers and business partners understand the values of the organization.
So far, we have focused on the internal effects of a code of conduct. But creating a code of conduct also has benefits in attracting new customers. Showing the values that the organization believes in, and backing it up with actions, can help engender a positive and receptive attitude from potential customers.</p>
<p>A Harvard Business Review survey shows the most significant driver of brand relationships is shared values (64%). In addition, 5WPR’s 2020 Consumer Culture Report found company values are more important for younger generations. For example, 83% aged 18-34 (the age group often described as millennials) agreed with the statement, “It is important to me that companies I buy from align with my values.”</p>
<p>Being able to showcase the ethics and principles an organization stands for will only become more critical in the modern marketplace. Creating an accurate and honest code of conduct that reflects the organization’s beliefs is a great starting point to let customers know who they are supporting with their business.</p>
<h3>What to include in a code of conduct</h3>
<p>While all businesses are different, and no two codes of conduct are the same, recurring factors and themes are found among successful ones.</p>
<p>Your organization’s specific purpose for adopting a code of conduct will define the scope to aim for. Some choose to focus on only the most essential values and guidelines to not overburden employees with information they may forget. Some seek to be more comprehensive and produce documentation covering as many aspects as possible.</p>
<p>Your code of conduct should include information in some form regarding:</p>
<p>The values your organization believes in
* Guidelines for behavior
* Day-to-day business practices
* How employees should interact with outside parties
It is also essential to define the procedures and consequences of code violations where applicable. It may be more challenging to identify a code of conduct violation when it comes to company values. However, employees should know the disciplinary processes for fixed rules (harassment, tardiness, etc.).</p>
<p>Listed below are important factors to consider for inclusion in your code of conduct. These are grouped into the four main areas described above. While covering every element detailed here may seem unrealistic, especially for new or small businesses, it is better to have something in place than react and define policies after an issue arises.</p>
<h4>Company values</h4>
<p>Details and topics related to the values the company holds itself to. This section allows the company to show the ethics and beliefs most dear to them and how they put this into action. This could include but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business ethics</li>
<li>Social responsibility</li>
<li>Environmental responsibility</li>
<li>Employee rights</li>
<li>Commitment and responsibility</li>
<li>Diversity and inclusion</li>
</ul>
<h4>Employee behavior</h4>
<p>Within a code of conduct, leadership must explain to all employees what is expected of them in terms of behavior and performance. This could be related to how they treat the people around them and communicate or specifics related to how they perform their role. A company could cover numerous employee behavior topics within a code of conduct. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standards of professionalism</li>
<li>Discrimination and sexual harassment policies</li>
<li>Use of company assets</li>
<li>Use of social media</li>
<li>Communication rules</li>
<li>Disciplinary process</li>
</ul>
<h4>Internal practices</h4>
<p>In this instance, internal practices refer to defined rules related to day-to-day business practices that are easy to explain. While similar to employee behavior, it is hard to define a simple black and white definition for “Standards of professionalism.” That topic requires more explanation to convey the expectation to an employee. Whereas a company’s rules related to attendance and punctuality is a set thing that is simple to understand. Examples of the internal practices a code of conduct could contain include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dress code</li>
<li>Annual leave/holiday time</li>
<li>Inclement weather policy</li>
<li>Break policy</li>
<li>Onboarding process</li>
<li>Job duties</li>
<li>Training guidelines</li>
<li>Rules related to time off through illness/injury</li>
<li>Attendance and punctuality</li>
<li>Use of phone while at work</li>
<li>Benefits</li>
<li>Chain of command</li>
<li>Legal compliance</li>
</ul>
<h4>External practices</h4>
<p>Finally, a code of conduct; should define the expectations for employees when dealing with external parties. For example, this could be in relation to confidential company material or a level of courtesy and respect when dealing with customers. There are many examples of external practices a code of conduct may define, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Intellectual property policies</li>
<li>Customer communication requirements</li>
<li>Conflict of interests</li>
<li>Code of conduct examples</li>
</ul>

<p>Architecture decisions must also be documented in the ADR-Files, see <a href="architecture/decisions">documentation/architecture/decisions</a>.</p>
<h2>17/01/2023 - Introduction of the Captains Log</h2>
<p>We introduced the captains log today. 
What do we keep here, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>information</li>
<li>decisions</li>
<li>milestones</li>
<li>agreements</li>
<li>debugging information or roadmaps on how we found a bug</li>
</ul>
<p>In short important updates about the code / project here.</p>
<p>The captains log should be <strong>immutable</strong>, this main that normally you do <strong>NOT CHANGE</strong> a previous entry, you can only add new ones.
As always there are exceptions, you can correct errors, mistakes in the previous ones, or if a filename has changed, ...</p>
